# 3. Use Rails 7

Date: 2022-02-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have a choice of technologies to host the application.  C# and Ruby (rails) are the prevelant technologies in the DfE teams.

## Decision

We have decided to use the Rails 7 web application framework.

## Consequences

* Gives us a head start as there are lots of boilerplate resources we can use to start our development quickly.
* Convetion based development increases development speed
* Well known build and deploy pipelines available to re-use
