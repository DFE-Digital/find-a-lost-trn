Dear <%= @trn_request.name %>,

You recently requested help with finding your teacher reference number (TRN). We’re sorry you did not get an acknowledgement at the time. This was due to a technical problem, which we’ve now resolved.

We’ve received the information you submitted, and you’ll get an email with your TRN if we find a match.

Otherwise, we’ll contact you for more information.

We aim to respond in 5 working days.
