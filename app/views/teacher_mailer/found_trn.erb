# What a TRN is for

You need to know your TRN to:

* view your record with the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA), check your record is accurate and download professional certificates in the Teacher self service portal https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login
* give to employers so they can complete mandatory teacher status checks
* to manage records of your contributions to the Teachersâ€™ Pensions scheme
* give to the Department for Education (DfE) when you have been awarded QTS so you can begin your early career teacher induction and access your early career framework induction training programme
