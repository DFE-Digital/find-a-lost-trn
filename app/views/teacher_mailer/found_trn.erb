# What a TRN is for

You need to know your TRN to:

* [access your teaching qualifications](https://access-your-teaching-qualifications.education.gov.uk) to download your initial certificates, change your name on them or check details of your initial teacher training and induction
* give to employers so they can complete mandatory teacher status checks
* manage records of your contributions to the Teachersâ€™ Pensions scheme
* give to the Department for Education (DfE) when you have been awarded QTS so you can begin your early career teacher induction and access your early career framework induction training programme
