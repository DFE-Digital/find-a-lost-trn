# Privacy notice

## Who we are

The Find a lost TRN service is run by the [Teaching Regulation Agency
(TRA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency/about),
an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE).

Our service allows anyone with a teacher reference number (TRN) to get a
reminder of their TRN by email.

For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the data controller for
the data we hold and process.

## What data we collect

We collect your:

- full name
- date of birth
- National Insurance number
- initial teacher training (ITT) provider (where you gained qualified teacher
  status (QTS) or early years teacher status (EYTS))
- email address

### Why we need your data

We need to collect this data so we can find your TRN in our records.

## Our legal basis for processing your data

So that our use of your personal data is lawful, we need to meet one (or more)
conditions in the data protection legislation. For our service, this is:

- article 6(1)(e) UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), to perform a
  public task carried out in the public interest as part of our function as a
  department

### What we do with your data

We use the data you give us to try and find your TRN in our records. If we can
match your data to our records, we’ll email your TRN to you. This allows you to
apply for teaching jobs or access other DfE services.

We use GOV.UK PaaS to run the service. [Visit the GOV.UK PaaS
website](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/privacy-notice/#what-data-we-collect-from-end-users)
to find out how they use and look after your data.

If we cannot find your TRN, you can either:

- call our helpdesk during working hours
- submit a service request to our helpdesk

If you do this, we will either:

- use the CX One telephony management service to handle your call to the
  helpdesk. CX One is managed by NICE Systems Ltd. [Visit the NICE
  website](https://www.nice.com/websites/CXone-WFO/privacy-policy.html) to find
  out how they look after your data.
- use the Zendesk customer management service to manage and respond to your
  query. [Visit the Zendesk
  website](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/company/privacy-and-data-protection/#faq-general-1)
  to find out how they look after your data.

## How long we keep your data

We’ll keep a record of who has made a request for a TRN reminder, and how many
requests have been made, for up to 2 years.

## Your data protection rights

You have the right:

- to ask us what information we hold about you
- to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete
- to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no
  compelling reason for its continued processing
- to restrict our processing of your personal data (for instance allow us to
  store it but not process it further)
- to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the
  purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics
- not to be subject to decisions based purely on automated processing where it
  produces a legal or similarly significant effect on you

If you have any questions about how we’ll use your personal information,

explicitly seek your consent to process your data.
