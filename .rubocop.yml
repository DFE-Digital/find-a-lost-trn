# The behavior of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml
# configuration file. It makes it possible to enable/disable
# certain cops (checks) and to alter their behavior if they accept
# any parameters. The file can be placed either in your home
# directory or in some project directory.
#
# RuboCop will start looking for the configuration file in the directory
# where the inspected file is and continue its way up to the root directory.
#
# See https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration

# This style is really nice and I like it, but unfortunately it breaks when
# combined with rbprettier. For some reason, the `gem` version of
# `@prettier/plugin-ruby` fails to correctly interpret the new hash style.
# There is a node_modules version of `rbprettier`, but that one seems to
# ignore `.prettierrc` and configuration that is passed into it via the CLI.
# Easiest thing to do for now is to disable this syntax.
